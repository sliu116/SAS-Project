This project conducts a statistical analysis in SAS to address some questions of interest for a specific dataset.
The dataset contains 4900 independent records of variables related to competitive powerlifters. 
Questions of Interest:
Is there a difference between the total amount a competitor lifts and the sex? What about different choice of equipment?
In addition, several models have been built to select a subset of predictors which are better at predicting the Wilkes score or help explaining whether a competitor won their last event?
